# Purpose of the Project #
The Calvin Ballon is a high-altitude balloon responsible for future broadcasting the 2017 solar eclipse. With the leverage of the solar eclipse, the project will dramatically the capabilities of Mercer's high altitude balloon progam and will provide phenomenal STEM education opportunities not just for Mercer students, but for all students at all education levels. 

# The Complexity of this Project
The complexity of this project means that there will be several teams working concurrently, to develop the critical systems, which will need to be ready for each flight. These systems include:
•	Primary computer package

•	Live photography package

•	Live videography package

•	Recoverable videography and photography package

•	Experiment support module

•	Communications package

•	Mission control

•	Audiovisual beacon module

# Summary of the Project #
Each of these systems will be designed, implemented, improved and operated by multidisciplinary teams of 2 to 5 students who will be matched to these subprojects based on their experience level skill sets and interests. This project is going to allow undergraduate students to have exposure to several extremely valuable engineering skill sets much earlier than they would otherwise in their engineering curriculum. These include: exposure to solid modeling, circuit board design, project planning, FAA compliance, test plan development, advanced programing, and many other important skills.
